# Phishing Website Detection

This project focuses on detecting phishing websites by extracting and analyzing key URL-based features. Using data from PhishTank and legitimate sources, several machine learning models were applied to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate.

## Feature Extraction
### Address Bar Based Features:
Domain of the URL
IP Address in URL
"@" Symbol in the URL
Length and Depth of the URL
Redirection using "//"
Use of "http/https" in the domain name
URL Shortening Services (e.g., TinyURL)
Prefix or Suffix "-" in the domain
